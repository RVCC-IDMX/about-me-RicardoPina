            Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their
            behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in
            general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of
            temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any
            attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.
            They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour
            when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves
            agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were
            rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
            seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in
            the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with
            people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to
            think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a
            respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more
            deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune
            and their own had been acquired by trade.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
            thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
            estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise,
            and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided
            with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to
            many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he
            might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave
            the next generation to purchase.
          </p>

          <p>
            His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
            though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by
            no means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who
            had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to
            consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had
            not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental
            recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and
            into it for half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the
            principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise,
            and took it immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite
            of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by
            the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no
            disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though
            with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of
            Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his
            judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the
            superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.
            He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his
            manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his
            friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked
            wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.
          </p>

          <p>
            The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was
            sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more
            pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been
            most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no
            stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to
            Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy,
            on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was
            little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the
            smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
            pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled
            too much.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they
            admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,
            and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was
            therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt
            authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.
          </p>

          <p>
            Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the
            Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been
            formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune,
            and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king
            during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too
            strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his
            residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had
            removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton,
            denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with
            pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy
            himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated
            by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he
            was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and
            obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him courteous.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
            valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The
            eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about
            twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.
