      <h2>An Excerpt From Pride and Prejudice</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour
          at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with
          more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her
          sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to
          herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in
          fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were
          pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they
          chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been
          educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune
          of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than
          they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore
          in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of
          others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a
          circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their
          brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
          thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
          estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise,
          and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided
          with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many
          of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might
          not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next
          generation to purchase.
        </p>

        <p>
          His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
          though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
          means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
          married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
          his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
          age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
          look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
          half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms,
          satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
          immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
          great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
          easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
          could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
          never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard,
          Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest
          opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no
          means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time
          haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred,
          were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the
          advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy
          was continually giving offense.
        </p>

        <p>
          The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was
          sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant
          people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and
          attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had
          soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he
          could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary,
          had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no
          fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from
          none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he
          acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
          her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
          they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
          established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
          commendation to think of her as he chose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
          were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in
          trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to
          the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his
          mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had
          given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small
          market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his
          family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that
          period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own
          importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in
          being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did
          not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to
          everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his
          presentation at St. James’s had made him courteous.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
          valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The
          eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about
          twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.
