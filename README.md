# About Me

Hi, my name is Ricardo Pina! Welcome to my personal portfolio website.

## Description

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/65fb2e59-9a9c-45b3-907a-03513192c61a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-ricardopina/deploys)

This website was built and designed for my Web Development course at Raritan Valley Community College. The website was built using the following:

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript (Basic animations)

The website's design was inspired by modern brutalism, a trending design style in the web dev community. It is growing in popularity because it combines old-school brutalism, characterized by harsh borders and flat design and modern animations and pastel colors.

## Color Scheme

A modern website must be accessible to all, which is why modern brutalism uses contrasting colors that adds style without compromising readability. The following colors were used:

| Usage            | Hex Code |
| :--------------- | :------: |
| Text Color       | #000000  |
| Alternate Text   | #ffffff  |
| Background Color | #C1ABE5  |
| Secondary Color  | #DD0662  |
| Accent Color     | #B2C5F6  |
